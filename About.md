### FAQ

#### Is Day F suitable for beginners?
We developed the app first of all for experienced users who are looking for new routines, those who might have already tried other fitness apps with predelivered programs and now would like to try something new, including creating and generating their own workouts. Day F doesn't provide detailed explanation of exercise techniques, and videos should be used for reference only - we would expect you to be familiar with most of the exercises and have your own preferred way of executing them. 
Having said that, it's perfectly fine if you are beginner - just make sure you get proper exercise technique explanation from a trusted source and practice them slowly with a proper form (ideally with a fitness professional by your side) before you jump on a high-intensity workout on Day F.

#### Are there predelivered workouts and programs on Day F I can use?
At this point we are focusing on generating workouts using different algorithms, later on this year we will add generated programs - they won't be much different from predelivered workouts and programs you are used to, except they will be unique and based on your level, goals and preferences.

#### What sort of workouts I can generate or create?
Day F focuses on bodyweight crossfit style exercises and workouts, and we are adding new exercises to the database regularly. However, if you would like to do a traditional strength training at the gym, you can create your own exercises and use them in your workouts. We might add other types of exercises at some point, but not any time soon.

#### Does the app track calories?
No, and it won't be. Calories burned during workout depend on too many factors, and we want to encourage people to move away from calory counting obsession and simply enjoy their workouts and be active as much as possible. 

#### Left, Right, Alternating, Per Side???
For single side exercises such as lunges, high knees, side planks etc you can specify exactly how the exercise should be performed: 
- Left/Right means you doing specified number of reps / seconds only on the left/right side.
- Per side means you perform specified number of reps / seconds on one side, and then the same number on the other side. E.g. 20 reps per side means "20 reps on the left side, AND AFTER 20 reps on the right side".
- Alternating means you perform specified number of reps / seconds on each side alternating between sides. E.g. 20 reps alternating means "20 reps on the left side + 20 reps on the right side" - so 40 reps in total.

#### Are generated workouts completely random?
No, they are not. We definitely don't want you to do 30 rounds of burpees ðŸ˜…. As you may have noticed, there are multiple attributes assigned to exercises such as Target area, Intensity, Effort, Preferred number of reps or time - we take all of them into account when running the algorithm, so the workouts will never be too hard or too easy for you. Just make sure you go through all the exercises and adjust attributes to suit your level in case they don't.
