title: About Day F
---
### Who we are.

We are a team of experienced IT and fitness professionals who got together and decided to build something completely new on the market - a fitness app that will keep you entertained throughout your fitness journey, an app where you can consolidate all your favourite workouts or build your own under 1 minute. 

### Our mission.

We strive to make fitness fun and efficient no matter your age, gender, fitness goals or level. 

### Why Day F.

- At Day F we pay a lot of attention to details. We realize how busy you might be, so we try to make it easy for you to create exercises and workouts by using speech recognition, execute workouts with animated exercises and timers, schedule and track your activity including your workouts from other fitness apps that integrate with Apple Health. 
- We have developed our proprietary workout generation algorithms which we will improve and expand. You can already try some of them on Day F.
- We introduce a lot of UI elements such as customizable images, themes, animations so it’s fun to use the app.
- We listen to your feedback and implement new features. Fast.
- Finally, it’s cheaper than most of the options you find on the App Store, and its feature list is growing fast.

### Upcoming features
- First of all, your feedback is our priority, so if many of you request a specific feature or a bug fix, we’ll build or fix it first. 
- New workout generation algorithms and custom filters
- A list of available equipment as a filter
